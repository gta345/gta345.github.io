<h1> Most popular method to attack UAV – GPS Spoofing </h1>
<h2> 1. Non-flying zone spoofing. </h2>
<h2> 2. Return-home point spoofing.</h2>
<h2> 3. Waypoint spoofing.</h2>

<h1> GPS Spoofing Principle </h1>

<p>In GPS system, we choose electromagnetic wave as the signal, so we know the velocity of electromagnetic wave , c. Then we try to get the duration t1 between sent and arrived.And we get the equation as below: </p>

<p>This equation cannot be solved since it has three unknowns. So we can simply add 
another two positions (satellites) whose coordinates are already known too. So we get the equation set as below: </p>

<p> Now, our position coordinate (x, y, z) can be solved out of the equations.
But it is not enough in engineering practice.  
Because local clock and satellite clock are not synchronized, there is a time deviation ∆t1 between them. The revised equation set as below: </p>

<p>The clocks carried by each GPS satellites are high precision atomic clocks, which are in strict synchronization state. So we have the following equation: </p>

<p>Still, we cannot solve this equation set for now. So we add the 4th satellite. 
The equation set becomes:</p>

<h1> How to generate spoofing GPS signals</h1>

<h1>Simulation procedure: </h1>
<p>1. Carrier Frequency: 1.57GHz. We generated the GPS signal tested on spectrum analyzer.</p>
<img src="http://s11.sinaimg.cn/middle/002Kx6Fvgy71dg6mLeWca&690" width="304" height="300">
<p>We found the generated signal waveform seat around the center frequency 1.57GHz. </p>

<p>2. We sent the signal into the airspace through USRP and tested the signal in my i-phone </p>

<p> This is the real location. After we sent the preset location information into airspace,
The location information received by my phone has been changed: </p>
<img src="http://s3.sinaimg.cn/middle/002Kx6Fvgy71dg60TIKd2&690" width="304" height="300">
<p> We can see that the GPS information in my phone has been changed to what we have sent 
through USRP. </p>

<h1> 3. Test on DJI Phantom I </h1>
<p> We moved the testing platform to the open area.</p>

<p>First, we got the longitude, latitude and elevation of the testing point.</p>

<p>Second, we turned on UAV and make it hover in a specific elevation(eg. 20m).</p>

<p>Then we generated the spoofing GPS signal and sent it into the airspace(we just changed
the elevation parameter to 100m)</p>

<p>Finally we found that the UAV dropped down to the ground. </p>
